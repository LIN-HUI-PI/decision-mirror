# Case Study — DM-CASE-2026-001

## Basic Information

Date: 2026-02-01  
Domain: Governance / AI / Systems Design  
Status: Phase 0

---

## Context

During the initial public release of Decision Mirror,
there was internal discussion about whether
to immediately pursue institutional partnerships
and certification pathways.

Some advisors suggested early alignment
with regulatory or corporate stakeholders.

---

## Proposed Change

Proposal to:
- Seek early institutional endorsement
- Align framework language with compliance standards
- Prepare certification pathways

---

## Boundary Assessment

Affected Principles:

- [x] Human veto
- [x] Deliberative entry points
- [ ] Reversibility awareness
- [x] Documentation discipline
- [x] Responsibility attribution

Primary Risk:
Premature institutional alignment
could shift governance authority externally.

---

## Decision

Outcome: Rejected (Deferred)

The proposal was postponed until
Phase 1 at the earliest.

---

## Rationale

Early institutional endorsement
was assessed to risk:

- Creating perceived authority
- Reducing critical distance
- Encouraging premature scaling
- Locking governance language too early

The framework was judged not yet mature
for external validation.

---

## Dissent

Some participants expressed concern
about missed funding and visibility opportunities.

These views were documented.

---

## Follow-up

Revisit after completion of Phase 0 review
and publication of at least three independent cases.
