# Decision Mirror — Canonical Definition v1.0

Decision Mirror is a governance framework designed to ensure
that system capabilities are introduced only after
human awareness and veto are structurally possible.

Any implementation that lacks:

- Human veto mechanisms
- Public decision records
- Documented boundary reviews
- Traceable responsibility

MUST NOT present itself as “Decision Mirror”.

This document defines the authoritative interpretation
of the framework.

Amendments require public review and versioning.
